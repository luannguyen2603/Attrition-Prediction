# Attrition-Prediction 
This is a simple web application that uses machine learning to predict the attrition of an employee bases on several features. 

I used Random Forrest algorithm to build the model since it has an acceptable prediction rate of over 80%.

Jupyter Notebook for data analysis (data cleansing, model choosing, features correlation...) should be uploaded in the near future.
