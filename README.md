# Attrition-Prediction 
This is a simple web application that uses machine learning to predict the attrition of an employee bases on several features. 

I used Random Forrest algorithm to build the model since it has an acceptable prediction rate of over 80%. I also explore the dataset with different models includes Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boosting Model.

Jupyter Notebook for data analysis (data cleansing, model choosing, features correlation...) is included for data analysis and visualization.

#Usage
1. Clone or download this respitory,
2. Run app.py
3. home.html should run on your local host at http://127.0.0.1:5000
4. Input numbers as requested,
5. Voila ! A prediction has been made for your employee.
6. Further reading of different models is included in Jupyter Notebook file
